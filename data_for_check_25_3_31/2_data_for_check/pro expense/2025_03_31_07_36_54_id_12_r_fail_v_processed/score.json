    "score": 1,
    "reason": "The agent starts by inputting an expense name and amount, which is not what the task asked for. The task was to view expense information for the week of March 30 - April 6. The agent then gets stuck in a loop of scrolling down, presumably looking for a 'Food' field, which is irrelevant to the task. The agent does not even attempt to view the expense information for the specified week."
