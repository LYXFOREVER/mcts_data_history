    "reason": "The agent starts by scrolling down to check for missed calls from yesterday. However, the initial state is the home screen, not the phone app. The agent then attempts to open the phone app, which is a correct step. After that, it continues to scroll down, but without a screenshot of the phone app, it's impossible to determine if the scrolling is effective. The agent is trying to complete the task, but the initial state is incorrect, and the lack of screenshots makes it difficult to assess the effectiveness of the scrolling actions."
