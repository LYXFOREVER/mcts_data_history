    "score": 3,
    "reason": "The agent correctly identifies the need to scroll down to find the contact after typing the name in the search bar. However, it scrolls down repeatedly without any change in the screen, indicating a potential issue with the agent's ability to recognize the contact or the end of the list. Finally, the agent attempts to navigate back, which is a reasonable step when the contact is not found. The task is not fully completed, but the agent demonstrates a logical approach."
