    "reason": "The agent successfully selects Friday as another day for the alarm. However, the agent fails to change the alarm sound to 'Echo'. The agent attempts to scroll down and up to find 'Echo', but it is not successful. The agent also tries to navigate back and re-enter the alarm settings, but it does not resolve the issue. The agent's actions are not always logical, and there are some unnecessary actions."
