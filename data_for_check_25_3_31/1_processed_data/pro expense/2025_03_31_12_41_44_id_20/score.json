    "reason": "The agent is trying to change the date of an expense log, but it's getting confused about the current state of the application. It navigates back and forth between the feedback form and the expense log creation screen, and it seems to be stuck in a loop. The agent also seems to be clicking the \"+\" button multiple times, even though it should only need to do so once to add a new expense log. The initial goal was to view expense logs, but the agent is now trying to change the date of an expense entry, which is a different task."
