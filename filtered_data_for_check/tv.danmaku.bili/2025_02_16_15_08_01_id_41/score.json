    "reason": "The agent starts by opening the Bilibili app. Then it enters a video's playback page, navigates back, and tries to enter the playback page of another video.

It is not clear why it keeps navigating back and forth, and it does not seem to be initiating a search. The actions contribute to the goal of browsing videos, although the instructions are not very clear."
