    "reason": "The agent successfully opens the app and navigates to March. However, it then gets confused and starts trying to navigate to February, even though the goal is to view March 19th. The agent also seems to be trying to create a task instead of just viewing the calendar. The agent is stuck in a loop of trying to go back to February."
