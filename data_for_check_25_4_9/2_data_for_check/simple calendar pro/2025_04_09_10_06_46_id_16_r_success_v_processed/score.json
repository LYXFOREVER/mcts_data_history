    "reason": "The agent successfully opens the app and attempts to navigate to the target month. It correctly identifies the need to click on the month/year to change it. However, the reasoning in step 2 is incorrect as the goal is to navigate to April 2024, not March 2025. The agent then attempts to click on the \"April\" button, which is correct. The agent then clicks on the year to select the year. The agent is on the right track to complete the task."
