    "reason": "The agent attempts to add a video to \"Watch Later\" but consistently encounters a \"Not Interested\" prompt instead of the expected menu. It tries to dismiss the prompt and scrolls down, but the trajectory doesn't show adding a video to the \"Watch Later\" playlist or canceling any actions related to the video '牧神记'. Therefore, the task is only partially completed."
