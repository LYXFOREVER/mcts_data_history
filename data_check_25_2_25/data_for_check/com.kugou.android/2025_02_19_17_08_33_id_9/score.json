    "score": 4,
    "reason": "The agent successfully opened the 酷狗音乐 app, searched for ‘辐射3’, and started to look for a playlist related to it. However, the task is to collect a playlist, not a song. The agent clicks the \"收藏\" button next to the song. The user wants to collect a playlist, \"歌单\" in Chinese means playlist. The agent clicks the 歌单 button to navigate to the playlist section. So, I would give a score of 4."
