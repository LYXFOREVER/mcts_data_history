    "score": 3,
    "reason": "The agent successfully opens the bilibili app and searches for '原神'. However, the trajectory gets stuck on a detail page of '原神' and cannot proceed to play the first video result. The agent then acknowledges the inability to stop the video automatically after 30 seconds, which is a limitation, but it does not complete the core task of playing the first video. The repetitive answering also hurts the score."
