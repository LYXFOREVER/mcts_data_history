    "score": 4,
    "reason": "The agent successfully opened the Bilibili app and navigated to the 'Dynamic' section. It then attempted to find the like button by scrolling and eventually clicked on what it believed was the like button (number of likes). While the agent's reasoning wasn't perfect (assuming the number of likes is the like button), it did perform actions towards the task goal. However, scrolling down multiple times wasn't efficient and suggests a lack of clear understanding of UI element placement."
