    "score": 2,
    "reason": "The agent opens the Chrome app and clicks on the \"More options\" button. However, the agent's reasoning is incorrect as it states that the user wants to change the default search engine, while the actual task is to open a new browsing tab. The agent then attempts to scroll down, which is not relevant to opening a new tab. Therefore, the trajectory deviates from the goal early on."
