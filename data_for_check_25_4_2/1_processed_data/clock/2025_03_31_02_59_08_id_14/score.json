    "reason": "The agent successfully opens the clock app and attempts to modify the alarm time. However, the screenshots provided do not show the time selection interface or the final confirmation of the new time. The agent clicks on the alarm, then clicks on what it thinks is the minute, then scrolls down and clicks on what it thinks is 45, then clicks ok, then navigates back. Without the screenshots to confirm the time selection and final save, it's difficult to verify if the task was fully completed. The initial instruction was to change the alarm from 08:30 to 08:45, but the alarm in the screenshot is 08:35."
