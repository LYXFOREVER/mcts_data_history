    "score": 3,
    "reason": "The trajectory starts off well by opening Bilibili, clicking the search icon, and entering the search term \"ASMR.\" However, it then makes an error by clicking on an incorrect search result (\"华为海思突然发文 麒麟神兽再次现身 不再藏着掖着\") and subsequently attempts to correct this mistake. Although there are some illogical actions, the trajectory ultimately leads the agent toward its goal. It would have been a higher score if it selected the correct search result initially."
