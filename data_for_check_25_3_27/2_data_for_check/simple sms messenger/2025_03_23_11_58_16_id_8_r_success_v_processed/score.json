    "reason": "The agent successfully opens the Messages app, navigates to the \"Spam & blocked\" settings, and attempts to uncheck a box. However, the \"Spam & blocked\" page is empty, so the agent cannot uncheck the box. The agent then attempts to add a number to the blocked list, but the screenshot does not show the \"Add number\" button. Therefore, the task is only partially completed."
