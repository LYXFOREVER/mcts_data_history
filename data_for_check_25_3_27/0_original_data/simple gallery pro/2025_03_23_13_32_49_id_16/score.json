    "score": 4,
    "reason": "The agent successfully composes and sends an email with the video attached. The steps are logical and follow the standard email composition process. However, the initial step of selecting Gmail from the share options is missing in the screenshots. The agent also attempts to check the sent folder, which is a good practice for confirmation. The task is mostly completed, but the lack of initial screenshots and the inability to fully confirm the sent email due to missing screenshots prevent a perfect score."
