    "score": 3,
    "reason": "The agent successfully opens the Contacts app and navigates to the contact creation screen. It correctly inputs the first name and last name. However, it fails to input the phone number correctly. It clicks on the \"Mobile\" label instead of the phone number field, and then inputs the phone number into the label selection. Finally, it tries to save the contact, but it fails because the phone number is not in the correct field. The agent also attempts to navigate back after saving, which is unnecessary."
