    "score": 4,
    "reason": "The agent successfully creates a new contact, inputs the first name, last name, and phone number. It also attempts to change the phone number label and add an email address, although the email address was not part of the original instructions. The agent initially opens the phone app instead of the contacts app, but it quickly corrects this. The task is mostly completed, but there are some inefficiencies. The agent also tries to add an email which was not part of the original instructions."
