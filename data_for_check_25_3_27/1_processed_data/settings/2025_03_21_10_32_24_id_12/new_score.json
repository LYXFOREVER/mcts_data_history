    "reason": "The agent initially scrolls down, then attempts to open the Calendar app instead of Messages. It then gets confused and tries to navigate the Calendar setup screens, even though the goal is to work with the Messages app. The agent then navigates back and forth between the home screen and the Messages app, but never actually explores the option to set it as the default SMS app. The agent is completely lost."
